# Firegirl-and-Waterboy
### About ###
Firegirl and Waterboy is a 2D platformer game with a similar play-style and mechanics as a childhood favourite game of ours - Fireboy and Watergirl. It is a local co-op where you work together with a partner to complete puzzles and to get through the levels, with levels increasing in difficulty.

Each level contains a range of puzzles and obstacles, like lava/water/acid, buttons and levers that trigger moving platforms and doors, and portals.

### Run Locally ###
